Daily UI 009

So, task was to create music player. And since I want to create that as
react app, I decided to focus mainly on visual representation here.
Which looks decent, but yeah, I did get idea for another react project.

In this challenge, I am kinda more adept at using Sass, at least,
at this basic level project. But I find it better learning at low
level projects because I am then building base knowledge that I will 
upgrade in next projects. Less making typo mistakes, less reading about basic 
things and more time to focus on pushing Sass to it's limits.

So, let's see what we will be building in next project!
